In this lesson we learned about javascript operators.

Operators are symbols that we use in our code when we want to perform a specific action. These include the likes of, add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), equal (=), devided by (/), less than (<), greater that (>), not (!), and (&&) or (||), and so on. These we very useful as we were able to perform a variety of tasks using them, and will be able to use them for many other tasks in the future. I believe it was important that we learned these as it is quite common to come across these sympols when writing our code.
We started off with Arithmetic operators. These are the basics ones such as addition and subtraction.
An example of code that we wrote was:
let x = 20;
let y = 10;

console.log(x + y)
//since we use the '+' symbol, this equation outputs a value of 30
console.log(x * y)
//since we use the '*' symbol, this equation outputs a value of 200
console.log(x - y)
//since we use the '-' symbol, this equation outputs a value of 10
console.log(x / y)
//since we use the '/' symbol, this equation outputs a value of 2

We then learned about Increment Operators. This increment the value of the variable by one. We identify and increment operator as a '++'

There are two types that we learned, Pre (++x) increment and post (x++) increment. A pre increment, increments the variable by one and then returns the variable. Whereas, a post increment, returns the variable, then increments the value by one.

here are a couple of examples that we learned:

Pre increment:

let x = 10

console.log(x);
